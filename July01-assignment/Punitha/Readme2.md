1. Given an array of integers of size, N. Assume ‘0’ as the invalid number and all others as a valid number. Write a program that modifies the array in such a way that if the next number is a valid number and is the same as the current number, double the current number value and replace the next number with 0. After the modification, rearrange the array such that all 0’s are shifted to the end and the sequence of the valid number or new doubled number is maintained as in the original array.

2. A number is said to be twisted prime if it is a prime number and reverse of the number is also a prime number.

3. Alex works at a clothing store. There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are. For example, there are n=7 socks with colors ar = {1,2,1,2,1,3,2}. There is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.

4. You are playing an online game. In the game list of the N numbers are given. The player has to arrange the numbers so that all the odd numbers of all the lists come after the even numbers. Write an algorithm to arrange an given list such that all the odd numbers of the list will come after the even numbers?
