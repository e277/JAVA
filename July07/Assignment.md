1. Write a Java program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
   degree.
   The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by
   physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as
   the unit.
   The Celsius scale, previously known as the centigrade scale, is a temperature scale
   used by the International System of Units (SI). As an SI derived unit, it is used by
   all countries in the world, except the U.S.
   Test Data
   Input a degree in Fahrenheit: 212
   Fahrenheit =((Celsius\*9)/5)+32;

2. Write a Java program that takes the user to provide a single character from
   the alphabet. Print Vowel or Consonant, depending on the user input. If the
   user input is not a letter (between a and z or A and Z), or is a string of length
   &gt; 1, print an error message. 
   Test Data
   Input an alphabet: p
   Expected Output :
   Input letter is Consonant

3. Write a Java program to form the largest number from a given list of non
   negative integers.   
   Example:
   Input :
   nums = {1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 6}
   Output:
   Largest number using the said array numbers: 643210
